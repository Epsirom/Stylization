# Epsirom's Stylization Library

Wow~ Such stylization!

## PaintTween

This project is based on the paper: <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ByExampleStylization/index.html" target=_blank>Stylizing Animation By Example (SIGGRAPH 2013)</a>, and was provided by the authors.

What I did is migrate it to newer APIs, especially newer CUDA, and provide a deployment guide on OS X 10.9.

## Nymph

The project of my stylization method and implementation.
